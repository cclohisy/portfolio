                    <p className="flow-text left-align">  I am full-stack web developer in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. I recieved my certificate through the
                    Univeristy of Minnesota in May 2018. The bootcamp had a rigorous curriculum that focused javascript, React.js, Node.js, MySql, and MongoDB.
                    I am currently looking for full-time positions focused on full-stack development.  </p>

                        For the past five years I worked in the financial services industry at WESTconsin Credit Union.
                        Most recently, I worked as the supervisor of a 15 person financial services team. I enjoyed the team I worked with, but was missing a creative outlet.
                        Once I decided I needed a carrer change, I knew bootcamp was right for me.
                        The fast pace intesive learning allowed me to really dig in and focus on mastering these new skils.

                        I am a hardworking and detail oriented individual. In my previous career I am experienced working on multi-departmental teams to identify and implement solutions, often through process improvement teams.
                        I have excellent communication skills which led me to success a supervisor. I also developed customer relationship recovery skills through dealing with customer concerns and complaints.
                    These past experinces and skills will allow me to excel as a web developer. </p>
